# Accessibility issues worksheet for 'Recording a goose sighting'
Make a copy of this locally (either in a Word Doc, Google Doc, on paper, or on your laptopâ€™s notepad), and use it as a worksheet for recording issues you find in this service.

## What testing tools to use
I would recommend working through the site in the following order:

- Can you access everything by pressing the tab key? 
- Does [WAVE](http://wave.webaim.org/) show any errors, or highlight any issues with the HTML structure?
- Does the colour contrast tab on WAVE throw up any errors?
- If you run the [Dark Mode browser extension](https://mybrowseraddon.com/dark-mode.html), can you see any issues with the site?

Government Digital Services have recently published [how to conduct a basic accessibility audit](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/doing-a-basic-accessibility-check-if-you-cant-do-a-detailed-one/doing-a-basic-accessibility-check-if-you-cant-do-a-detailed-one), which is worth a look at too.
