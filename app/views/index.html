        'Record a goose sighting' accessibility exercise instructions
      </h1>

      <p>'Record a goose sighting' is a made-up government service, filled with accessibility issues. Your task is to find them all! If you'd like to know more about the background, visit the blog post about this, <a href="https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/2020/01/14/training-people-to-do-accessibility-reviews/">'Training people to do accessibility reviews'.</a></p>

      <p>To identify the issues, you'll want to use keyboard testing, and WAVE. More details are in a <a class="govuk-link" href="/steps/worksheet">worksheet you'll need to accompany this exercise.</a>
        <p></p>

      <p>There are 6 pages in total:</p>
