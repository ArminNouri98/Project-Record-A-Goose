          'Record a Goose Sighting' Accessibility Exercise Instructions
        </h1>

        <p>'Record a Goose Sighting' is a made-up government service, filled with accessibility issues. Your task is to find them all!</p>

        <p>To help find the issues, you will need to use the <a href="https://wave.webaim.org/extension/">WAVE accessibility plugin</a> with either Chrome or Firefox. You'll also need to try completing the exercise using just your keyboard. Make sure to read these tips on <a class="govuk-link" href="/steps/worksheet">what to look for and how to record your findings</a>.</p>

        <p>There are 6 pages in total:</p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>Start page</li>
          <li>Do you like geese?</li>
          <li>What type of goose did you see?</li>
          <li>When did you see the goose?</li>
          <li>Check your answers</li>
          <li>Confirmation page</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Accessibility issues start on the next page. Good luck!</p>
